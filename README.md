# energysupply_and_gdp
This repository contains considerations and data manipulation about energy supply and gdp of some countries. 


The instructions for the codes contained in this repository were given by the university of michigan, through the coursera platform. 
However, I developed the codes entirely on my own.
The data that I used ins avaiable here and I'm open to ask any doubts.
